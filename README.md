## DepMap-CellLine-GeneExpression-Analysis

### DepMap Cancer Cell Line Gene Expression Profiling

##### This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project focused on exploring and comparing gene expression profiles of cancer cell lines from the DepMap Public data portal. It demonstrates robust data loading, preprocessing, quality control (including NA handling, duplicate detection, and dataset overlap), and an initial differential gene expression analysis comparing specific cancer cell lines against non-cancerous controls. Visualizations include Venn diagrams for data overlap, bar plots of top up/downregulated genes, and volcano plots for differential expression analysis.
